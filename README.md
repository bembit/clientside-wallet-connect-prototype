## Client Side Wallet Connect Demo, Prototype

### TL;DR - What is this?

I wanted a simple client side crypto wallet connect demo, without librairies.
Spent a week on it, just to understand how this wallet login thing works, or could work if written properly.

### If you have a wallet extension installed, you will see a button to connect a wallet to the site.

1. Connect a wallet.
2. Get a div with the address.
3. Div has the custom attribute walletaddress="0xea....whatever"
4. Can be used to validate on blockchain, or whatever you want to do with it.
